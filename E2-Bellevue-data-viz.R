#### 3. Your turn: pick at least two ####
# Each starter works as is. Change it, label it, and save the one you like.

# (a) The ten most common reasons for admission (a bar chart).
#     aes(y = ...) puts the bars sideways so the labels are readable.
bellevue %>%
  count(reason_cleaned) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = reorder(reason_cleaned, n))) +

# (b) The ages of the people admitted (a histogram). Why are some bars so much
#     taller than their neighbors? (Try binwidth = 1.) Look at the far right too:
#     is every age believable? What should a historian do with them?
ggplot(bellevue, aes(x = age_standard)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)

# (c) Ages by gender (a boxplot). Try geom_violin() instead of geom_boxplot().
ggplot(bellevue, aes(x = gender, y = age_standard)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# (d) Reasons over time, one small graph per reason (facets). Compare "sickness"
#     and "recent emigrant" after June 1847. What might be going on?
bellevue %>%
  filter(reason_cleaned %in% c("sickness", "recent emigrant", "destitution", "intemperance")) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ reason_cleaned)

# (e) The top "occupations." Color the bars by gender with aes(fill = gender).
#     What does it mean that "married," "spinster," and "widow" appear here?

  count(occupation, gender) %>%
